For file uploading we are using multer and cloudinary

cloudinary
 ->It is a third party service used to store images and videos
 ->We will get a url from here and that url is stored in the database
 ->It is better for improving performance and scalability


Multer 
 ->It is a middleware for handling file uploads in NodeJS/ExpressJS

When a user uploads a file through a form the browser sends the file in
multi-part/form-data format.
By default express cant read that type of request body
So Multer:
  ->Parses the incoming file
  ->Stores the file temporarily
  ->Makes it readable to the backend


So multer gets the uploaded file to the backend and stores it temporarily.
Once this file is uploaded to a third party servcie like AWS or Cloudinary the temporarily stored file will be deleted from the backend
